Eich (University of Stuttgart) on 20 Aug. 2015 and posted with his permission. Dr. Eich noted, "That the provided tables are directly obtained by the fitting process for the Fe-Cr interaction without subsequent transformation into the effective pair format. This was done in the publication for comparison, but the additional rescaling of the electron density for pure components wouldn't describe the energetics of alloys correctly unless the rescaling has been performed before starting the fitting routine (which then would affect the fitting process)." Dr. Eich noted that the distance units are Angstroms and the energy units are eV.</text></notes><artifact><web-link><URL>https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/Download/2015--Eich-S-M-Beinke-D-Schmitz-G--Fe-Cr/1/Cr_Olsson_2005_embed.txt</URL><label>Fe F(&amp;rho;):</label><link-text>Cr_Olsson_2005_embed.txt</link-text></web-link></artifact><artifact><web-link><URL>https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/Download/2015--Eich-S-M-Beinke-D-Schmitz-G--Fe-Cr/1/Cr_Olsson_2005_dens.txt</URL><label>Fe &amp;rho;(r):</label><link-text>Cr_Olsson_2005_dens.txt</link-text></web-link></artifact><artifact><web-link><URL>https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/Download/2015--Eich-S-M-Beinke-D-Schmitz-G--Fe-Cr/1/Cr_Olsson_2005_pair.txt</URL><label>Fe &amp;phi;(r):</label><link-text>Cr_Olsson_2005_pair.txt</link-text></web-link></artifact><artifact><web-link><URL>https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/Download/2015--Eich-S-M-Beinke-D-Schmitz-G--Fe-Cr/1/Fe_Ackland_2004_embed.txt</URL><label>Cr F(&amp;rho;):</label><link-text>Fe_Ackland_2004_embed.txt</link-text></web-link></artifact><artifact><web-link><URL>https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/Download/2015--Eich-S-M-Beinke-D-Schmitz-G--Fe-Cr/1/Fe_Ackland_2004_dens.txt</URL><label>Cr &amp;rho;(r):</label><link-text>Fe_Ackland_2004_dens.txt</link-text></web-link></artifact><artifact><web-link><URL>https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/Download/2015--Eich-S-M-Beinke-D-Schmitz-G--Fe-Cr/1/Fe_Ackland_2004_pair.txt</URL><label>Cr &amp;phi;(r):</label><link-text>Fe_Ackland_2004_pair.txt</link-text></web-link></artifact><artifact><web-link><URL>https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/Download/2015--Eich-S-M-Beinke-D-Schmitz-G--Fe-Cr/1/Fe_Cr_Eich_2015_TBM_sembed_Fe.txt</URL><label>Fe Fs(&amp;rho;s):</label><link-text>Fe_Cr_Eich_2015_TBM_sembed_Fe.txt</link-text></web-link></artifact><artifact><web-link><URL>https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/Download/2015--Eich-S-M-Beinke-D-Schmitz-G--Fe-Cr/1/Fe_Cr_Eich_2015_TBM_sembed_Cr.txt</URL><label>Cr Fs(&amp;rho;s):</label><link-text>Fe_Cr_Eich_2015_TBM_sembed_Cr.txt</link-text></web-link></artifact><artifact><web-link><URL>https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/Download/2015--Eich-S-M-Beinke-D-Schmitz-G--Fe-Cr/1/Fe_Cr_Eich_2015_TBM_sdens.txt</URL><label>Fe-Cr &amp;rho;s(r):</label><link-text>Fe_Cr_Eich_2015_TBM_sdens.txt</link-text></web-link></artifact><artifact><web-link><URL>https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/Download/2015--Eich-S-M-Beinke-D-Schmitz-G--Fe-Cr/1/Fe_Cr_Eich_2015_TBM_pair.txt</URL><label>Fe-Cr &amp;phi;(r):</label><link-text>Fe_Cr_Eich_2015_TBM_pair.txt</link-text></web-link></artifact></implementation><element>Fe</element><element>Cr</element></interatomic-potential>
