The original potential is a rigorously parameterized analytical bond order potential for ternary the Cd–Zn–Te systems. This potential effectively captures property trends of multiple Cd, Zn, Te, CdZn, CdTe, ZnTe, and Cd&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Te phases including clusters, lattices, defects, and surfaces. It also enables crystalline growth simulations of stoichiometric compounds/alloys from non-stoichiometric vapors. However, the potential over predicts the zinc-blende CdTe lattice constant compared to experimental data. Here, we report a refined analytical Cd–Zn–Te bond order potential parameterization that predicts a better CdTe lattice constant. Characteristics of the second potential are given based on comparisons with both literature potentials and the quantum mechanical calculations.</abstract><pages>5469-5477</pages><DOI>10.1007/s00894-013-2004-8</DOI><bibtex>@article{Ward_2013,\n abstract = {This paper reports an updated parameterization for a CdTe bond order potential.
