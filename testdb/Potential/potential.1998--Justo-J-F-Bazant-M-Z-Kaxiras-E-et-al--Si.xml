The model consists of two- and three-body interactions with theoretically motivated functional forms that capture chemical and physical trends as explained in a companion paper. The numerical parameters in the functional form are obtained by fitting to a set of ab initio results from quantum-mechanical calculations based on density-functional theory in the local-density approximation, which include various bulk phases and defect structures.

It is the only potential known to describe both the 30°- and 90°-partial dislocations in the glide set &amp;#123;111&amp;#125;. The structural and thermodynamic properties of the liquid and amorphous phases are also in good agreement with experimental and ab initio results. Our potential is capable of simulating a quench directly from the liquid to the amorphous phase, and the resulting amorphous structure is more realistic than with existing empirical preparation methods.
