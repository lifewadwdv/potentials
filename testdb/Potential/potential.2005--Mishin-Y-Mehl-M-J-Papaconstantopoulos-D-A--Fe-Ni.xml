The most stable compounds are L12–Ni3Fe, L10–FeNi, C11f–Ni2Fe and C11f–Fe2Ni. The L12-Ni3Fe compound has the largest negative formation energy, which is consistent with the experimental Fe–Ni phase diagram.

In comparison with the existing modified EAM method, our potential form is simpler, extends interactions to several (3–5) coordination shells and replaces the screening procedure by a smooth cutoff of the potential functions.
