As such, many structures incorrectly had energy lower than diamond lattice. This version fixes the bug by increasing the maximum tabulated rho from 1.0 to 2.0, and gives the right hierarchy of the crystal structures."</text></notes><artifact><web-link><URL>https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/Download/2018--Starikov-S-V-Lopanitsyna-N-Y-Smirnova-D-E-Makarov-S-V--Si-Au/2/Si_Au.mod.adp.txt</URL><link-text>Si_Au.mod.adp.txt</link-text></web-link></artifact></implementation><element>Si</element><element>Au</element></interatomic-potential>
