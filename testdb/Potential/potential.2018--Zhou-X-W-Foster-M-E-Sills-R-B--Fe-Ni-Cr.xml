Atomistic studies of mechanical properties of stainless‐steels, however, have been limited by the lack of high‐fidelity interatomic potentials. Here using density functional theory as a guide, we have developed a new Fe‐Ni‐Cr embedded atom method potential. We demonstrate that our potential enables stable molecular dynamics simulations of stainless‐steel alloys at high temperatures, accurately reproduces the stacking fault energy-known to strongly influence the mode of plastic deformation (e.g., twinning vs. dislocation glide vs. cross‐slip)-of these alloys over a range of compositions, and gives reasonable elastic constants, energies, and volumes for various compositions.
