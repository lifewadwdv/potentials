Professor Farkas notes "The update is to make the potentials go to zero smoothly for distances of 5.8 Å.  The original version went up to 6 Å and the last 0.2 Å were not smooth.  This does not affect any of the common calculations but may make a difference in some cases like Peierls stresses of dislocations."</text></notes><artifact><web-link><URL>https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/Download/2018--Farkas-D-Caro-A--Fe-Ni-Cr-Co-Cu/2/FeNiCrCoCu-heafixed.setfl</URL><link-text>FeNiCrCoCu-heafixed.setfl</link-text></web-link></artifact></implementation><element>Fe</element><element>Ni</element><element>Cr</element><element>Co</element><element>Cu</element></interatomic-potential>
