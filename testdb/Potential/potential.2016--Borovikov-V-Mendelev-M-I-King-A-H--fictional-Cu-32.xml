Dr. M.I. Mendelev (Ames Laboratory) noted that these are new fictional potentials intended to supplement the existing potentials posted to the NIST repository (as the 2015--Borovikov-V-Mendelev-M-I-King-A-H-LeSar-R--fictional-Cu-# listings). Dr. Mendelev further noted that, "the new potentials provide the same SFE as &lt;a href="https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/entry/2013--Mendelev-M-I-King-A-H--Cu/"&gt;2013--Mendelev-M-I-King-A-H--Cu&lt;/a&gt; but different unstable stacking fault energy (USFE). All these Cu fictional potentials are designed to study the effect of SFE and USFE on the deformation behavior in fcc metals."
