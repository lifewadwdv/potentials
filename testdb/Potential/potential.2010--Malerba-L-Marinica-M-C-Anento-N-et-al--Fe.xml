Marinca in 2007. The potential uses EAM formalism and was fitted on a database point defect oriented. The performance of the potential is tested in the above 2010 reference. Someone using this potential should cite the above two papers.</text></notes></description><implementation><key>784d3863-5c64-4ab8-9323-3009f907bd45</key><id>2010--Malerba-L--Fe--LAMMPS--ipr1</id><status>active</status><date>2017-01-10</date><type>LAMMPS pair_style eam/fs</type><notes><text>This file was sent by M.-C.
