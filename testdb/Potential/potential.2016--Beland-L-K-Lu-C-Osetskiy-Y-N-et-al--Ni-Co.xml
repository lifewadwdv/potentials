We first applied the effective gauge transformation, and then fitted the cross-term as to reproduce the heat of mixing of Ni(x)-Co(1-x). The potential is very soft at short distances. In order to perform collision cascades, it should be overlaid to the ZBL potential, with an outer cutoff of 2.0 Angstroms."</text></notes></description><implementation><key>fae88fec-37b2-4e96-95b6-81356dc3289a</key><id>2016--Beland-L-K--Ni-Co--LAMMPS--ipr1</id><status>active</status><date>2019-11-08</date><type>LAMMPS pair_style eam/alloy</type><notes><text>This file was provided by Laurent Béland on 7 Nov 2019 and posted with his permission.
