It has a melting point of 1796 K."</text></notes><artifact><web-link><URL>https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/Download/2004--Ackland-G-J-Mendelev-M-I-Srolovitz-D-J-et-al--Fe-P/1/fep4.19</URL><link-text>fep4.19</link-text></web-link></artifact></implementation><implementation><key>acfed907-de44-4ade-b3cf-b680935dba28</key><id>2004--Ackland-G-J--Fe-P--LAMMPS--ipr1</id><status>active</status><date>2007-06-12</date><type>LAMMPS pair_style eam/fs</type><notes><text>This file was provided by Mikhail Mendelev.
