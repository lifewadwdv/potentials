According to Stephen M. Foiles, they differ from the original formulations in the following ways: a) The fcc is upper case in one and lower case in the other. b) The comment in the LAMMPS distribution for Ni_smf7.eam incorrectly lists it as being for the NiPd alloys rather than NiCu alloys. The potential file has been updated with "NiCu" to reflect the second comment.</text></notes><artifact><web-link><URL>https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/Download/1985--Foiles-S-M--Ni-Cu/1/Cu_smf7.eam</URL><link-text>Cu_smf7.eam</link-text></web-link></artifact><artifact><web-link><URL>https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/Download/1985--Foiles-S-M--Ni-Cu/1/Ni_smf7.eam</URL><link-text>Ni_smf7.eam</link-text></web-link></artifact></implementation><element>Ni</element><element>Cu</element></interatomic-potential>
