The first step is the development of a new interatomic potential for Fe in Al. This potential provides an accurate description of Al–Fe liquid diffraction data and the bulk diffusivity of Fe in Al. We use this potential to determine the physical parameters in the Cahn–Lücke–Stüwe (CLS) model for the effect of impurities on grain boundary mobility. These include the heat of segregation of Fe to grain boundaries in Al and the diffusivity of Fe in Al. Using the simulation-parameterized CLS model, we predict the grain boundary mobility in Al in the presence of Fe as a function of temperature and Fe concentration. The order of magnitude and the trends in the mobility from the simulations are in agreement with existing experimental results.</br>\n"

We introduced an electronic structure embedding approach to improve the description of the point defects in first-principles calculations, by including the semicore electrons in some V atoms (those near the interstitial where the semicore levels are broadened) but not those further from the point defect. This enables us to combine good accuracy for the defect within large supercells and to expand the data set of first-principles point defect calculations in vanadium with and without small amounts of iron. Based on these data, previous first-principles work, and new calculations on the alloy liquid, we fitted an interatomic potential for the V-Fe system which describes the important configurations likely to arise when such alloys are exposed to radiation. This potential is in a form suitable for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of large systems. Using the potential, we have calculated the migration barriers of vacancies in the presence of iron, showing that these are broadly similar. On the other hand, MD simulations show that V self-diffusion at high temperatures and Fe diffusion are greatly enhanced by the presence of interstitials.</br>\n"
