    abstract = {A simple procedure is used to formulate a Cu–Pb pair interaction function within the embedded atom (EAM) method framework. Embedding, density and pair functions for pure Cu and pure Pb are taken from previously published EAM studies. Optimization of the Cu–Pb potential was achieved by comparing with experiment the computed heats of mixing for Cu–Pb liquid alloys and the equilibrium phase diagram, the latter being determined via a thermodynamic integration technique. The topology of the temperature-composition phase diagram computed with this EAM potential is consistent with experiment and features a liquid–liquid miscibility gap, low solubility of Pb in solid Cu and a monotectic reaction at approximately 1012 K.}
