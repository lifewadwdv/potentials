    abstract = {A novel embedded atom method (EAM) potential for the Ξ phases of Al-Pd-Mn has been determined with the force-matching method. Different combinations of analytic functions were tested for the pair and transfer part. The best results are obtained if one allows for oscillations on two different length scales. These potentials stabilize structure models of the Ξ phases and describe their energy with high accuracy. Simulations at temperatures up to 1200 K show very good agreement with ab initio results with respect to stability and dynamics of the system.}
