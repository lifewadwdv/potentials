    abstract = {Using the force-matching method we develop an interatomic potential that allows us to study the structure and properties of α-U, γ-U and liquid uranium. The potential is fitted to the forces, energies and stresses obtained from ab initio calculations. The model gives a good comparison with the experimental and ab initio data for the lattice constants of α-U and γ-U, the elastic constants, the room-temperature isotherm, the normal density isochore, the bond-angle distribution functions and the vacancy formation energies. The calculated melting line of uranium at pressures up to 80 GPa and the temperature of the α-γ transition at 3 GPa agree well with the experimental phase diagram of uranium.}
