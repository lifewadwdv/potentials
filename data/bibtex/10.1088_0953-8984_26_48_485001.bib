    abstract = {In this work we developed an embedded atom method potential for large scale atomistic simulations in the ternary tungsten–hydrogen–helium (W–H–He) system, focusing on applications in the fusion research domain. Following available ab initio data, the potential reproduces key interactions between H, He and point defects in W and utilizes the most recent potential for matrix W. The potential is applied to assess the thermal stability of various H–He complexes of sizes too large for ab initio techniques. The results show that the dissociation of H–He clusters stabilized by vacancies will occur primarily by emission of hydrogen atoms and then by break-up of V–He complexes, indicating that H–He interaction does influence the release of hydrogen.}
