The potential predicts binding energies of various small oxygen-vacancy clusters in \u03b1-iron in good agreement with density functional theory results, and is therefore suitable for simulations of oxygen-based defects in iron. We apply the potential in simulations of the stability and structure of Fe/FeO interfaces and FeO precipitates in iron, and observe that the shape of FeO precipitates can change due to formation of well-defined Fe/FeO interfaces. The interface with crystalline Fe also ensures that the precipitates never become fully amorphous, no matter how small they are.",
