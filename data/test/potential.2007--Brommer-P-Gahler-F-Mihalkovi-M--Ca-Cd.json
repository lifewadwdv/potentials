With these potentials, the ideal cluster structure and the couplings between neighbouring clusters are determined. From these data, an effective Hamiltonian for the cluster orientations is derived. The Hamiltonian is used in Monte Carlo simulations, which exhibit a sharp jump in the internal energy near the expected transition temperature.",
