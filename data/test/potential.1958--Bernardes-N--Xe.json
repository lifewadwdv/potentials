Mie-Lennard-Jones 6-12 potentials appropriate to the gas-phase data are used throughout, and the importance of quantum-mechanical effects is discussed; in general, good agreement with experiment is obtained. From the theoretical zero-point energies equivalent Debye temperatures, \u03b8, are calculated, and from the dependence of these \u03b8 on volume, Gr\u00fcneisen constants are computed in good agreement with experiment. Theoretical compressibility curves (at 0\u00b0K) are presented, and compared with the available experimental data; in the case of Ne, the only substance for which high-pressure data are available, the agreement is rather good up to 20 k atmos.",
