This is remedied by adding to the potentials cores fitted to electron gas calculations on dimers. The adjusted potentials are shown to predict a more realistic pressure-volume relationship. Interstitial formation energies are calculated for various configurations, using quenched molecular dynamics and static relaxation. Some preliminary results on interstitial migration are presented.",
