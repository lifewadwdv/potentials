The original potential is a rigorously parameterized analytical bond order potential for ternary the Cd\u2013Zn\u2013Te systems. This potential effectively captures property trends of multiple Cd, Zn, Te, CdZn, CdTe, ZnTe, and Cd<sub>1-x</sub>Zn<sub>x</sub>Te phases including clusters, lattices, defects, and surfaces. It also enables crystalline growth simulations of stoichiometric compounds/alloys from non-stoichiometric vapors. However, the potential over predicts the zinc-blende CdTe lattice constant compared to experimental data. Here, we report a refined analytical Cd\u2013Zn\u2013Te bond order potential parameterization that predicts a better CdTe lattice constant. Characteristics of the second potential are given based on comparisons with both literature potentials and the quantum mechanical calculations.",
