The intermediate-range order represented by the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) in the neutron static structure factor shows a significant dependence on the system size. Correlations in the range 0.4\u20131.1 nm are found to play a vital role in determining the shape of the FSDP correctly. The calculated structure factor for the largest system is in excellent agreement with neutron diffraction experiments, including the height of the FSDP.",
