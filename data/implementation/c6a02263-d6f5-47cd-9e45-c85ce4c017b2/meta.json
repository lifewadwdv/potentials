            "text": "A new implementation was sent by Dr. Sergey Starikov on 1 October 2018 and posted with his permission with the following comments: \"The old version of the potential (above) could not correctly describe several dense structures of silicon (like fcc and hcp) as the explored values of density (rho) exceeded those tabulated.  As such, many structures incorrectly had energy lower than diamond lattice. This version fixes the bug by increasing the maximum tabulated rho from 1.0 to 2.0, and gives the right hierarchy of the crystal structures.\""
