He noted that the potential is designed to simulate liquid properties and melting. 31 May 2013: The parameter file was renamed from Ni1_Mendelev_2010.eam.fs to Ni1_Mendelev_2012.eam.fs and the first line in the file's header was updated to reflect the publication status. Mikhail Mendelev approved this change."
