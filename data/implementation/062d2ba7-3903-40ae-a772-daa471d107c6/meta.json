Foiles, they differ from the original formulations in the following ways: a) The fcc is upper case in one and lower case in the other. b) The comment in the LAMMPS distribution for Ni_smf7.eam incorrectly lists it as being for the NiPd alloys rather than NiCu alloys. The potential file has been updated with \"NiCu\" to reflect the second comment."
