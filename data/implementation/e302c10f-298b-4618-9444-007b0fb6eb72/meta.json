            "text": "This file was recieved by Sergei Starikov on August 2, 2018. He noted: \"In the previous version, one function for Mo-Mo interaction had poor smoothing with r=r_cut. This \"bug\" led to the sake of the energy conservation during high-temperature (or long) calculations for pure Mo or U-Mo alloy. I made an additional check and found a small potential compilation issue leading to this energy drift. I fixed the file, so now it can be safely used with the time-step = 0.5 fs, even for long runs at high temperatures (the test was made for 1500K).\""
