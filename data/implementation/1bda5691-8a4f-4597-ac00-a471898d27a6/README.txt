These functions may not look like in the relevant Figures of the paper due to the invariant transformations. However, all properties of the phases must be exactly the same.

To use these tabulated functions in simulations, apply cubic spline interpolation between the tabulated points. In fact, even linear interpolation give very accurate results.
