                "text": "Dr. Peng Wang noted that this potential for TWIP steel was developed based on the concept \"meta-atom method\". The meta-atom method is developed based on the basic assumption that the mechanical properties of an alloy system are primarily governed by a finite set of material constants instead of specific atomic configurations. Once the completeness of this set of material constants is established, two systems with the same material constants should exhibit identical mechanical behaviors in experimental observations. In this way, a detailed distinction among various atomic species is discarded and an alloy system is represented by a set of meta-atoms with a single interatomic potential to fit all related material constants. This method is firstly published in Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids (2017), 98, 290-308. It is not possible to model individual elements of Fe or Mn with this potential."
