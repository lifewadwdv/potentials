Kullgren included the following notes: \"Usage: The parameters have been tested for static calculations of CeO2 and partially reduced CeO(2-x) using the LAMMPS code with the fortran implementation of reaxFF. For energy comparisons, use the in-cell approach (see the paper) when calculating reaction energies. Note to the users: After publication we have made further use of the published ceria parameters and noticed an additional (false) local minimum occurring for partially reduced ceria at a short Ce-O distance (approx. 1.89 Angstrom). This may (for example) have consequences for dynamic simulations at moderate temperatures. Our attempts to heal this deficiency have so far destroyed the good performance regarding the ordering of the surface vacancy energies on the (111) surface. In relevant cases, we advice our users to analyze the bond distances from the simulations.\""
