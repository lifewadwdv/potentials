                "text": "G.J. Ackland noted that lattice parameters, elastic constants and cohesive energies were used in the fitting process, so the values produced by this conversion should match known values. He noted that bcc crystal structure should be stable and produce a melting temperature of 551 K. Publication information was updated on 12 Oct. 2017. Prior publication listing for this potential was Han, S., Zepeda-Ruiz, L. A., Ackland, G. J., Car, R., and Srolovitz, D. J. (2003).
