                "text": "Dr. Sasan Nouranian (Center for Advanced Vehicular Systems, Mississippi State Univ.) noted: \"These MEAM parameters for elements C and H as well as the diatomic CH are appropriate for energy minimization and reactive molecular dynamics simulations of SATURATED hydrocarbons, where all carbon atoms have the sp<sup>3</sup> hybridization (single C-C bonds). At the current state, MEAM cannot handle unsaturated compounds with great accuracy. Furthermore, these C and H parameters are not appropriate for diamond and graphite systems. For the first time, MEAM can be used to simulate hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon/metal systems, since it has a large parameter database for major metals in the periodic table of elements. Since MEAM is a reactive potential, it can also be used to simulate fracture and fatigue in hydrocarbon-based polymers, such as polyethylene and polypropylene and their composites with nanometals as well as polymer/metal interfaces.\""
